Simplify
========

Simplify is a “simple” texture pack for Minecraft.

This is my first (and so far only) texture pack. It is a “simple” pack (thus the name), featuring basic recurring shapes and color palettes, and shaded edges to help tell adjacent blocks apart. It is similar to [Tiny Pixels][] or [BoxCraft][], but I made it myself, using only the default textures as a starting point.
