*__Please note:__ Simplify is currently on hiatus until [Fenhl](https://github.com/Fenhl) figures out what is causing issues [#1](https://github.com/Fenhl/Simplify/issues/1) and [#2](https://github.com/Fenhl/Simplify/issues/2).*

**Simplify** is a resource pack for [Minecraft][] currently containing mainly textures. It is a “simple” pack (thus the name), featuring basic recurring shapes and color palettes, and shaded edges to help tell adjacent blocks apart. While textures may appear similar to those in other resource packs, they were created by Fenhl, using only the default textures as a starting point.

This resource pack should update whenever Minecraft updates, so if it lacks textures or other assets from the latest Minecraft release, feel free to submit an issue.

There are some [screenshots][].

Download
========

If you download Simplify as a zip, you can put the file in the resource packs folder and it will work.

You can also clone the repository.
