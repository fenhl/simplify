Simplify
========

Simplify is a texture pack for [Minecraft][]. It is a “simple” pack (thus the name), featuring basic recurring shapes and color palettes, and shaded edges to help tell adjacent blocks apart. While it may appear similar to other texture packs, it was created by Fenhl, using only the default textures as a starting point.

This texture pack should update whenever Minecraft updates, so if it lacks textures from the latest minecraft release, feel free to submit an issue.

There are some [screenshots][].

Download
========

If you download the texture pack as a zip, you can put the file in the texture packs folder and it will work.

You can also clone the repository.

Finally, there is an AdF.ly supported [mirror][FenuSrv mirror] (which may be outdated).
